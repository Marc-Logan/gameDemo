step1 : display player + player can move left/right
- create project structure (html, css, js)

- class game
    - start () --> create instance 

- class player
     - position
     - size 
     - moveLeft()
     - moveRight()
- class obstacle

- functionality to move player

step2 : obstacles appearing in the UI + obstacles move + detect if there's a collision
    - its okay if the obstacles appear always at same position

step3 : make game more interesting + fix bugs
